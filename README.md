# RAG Techniques - 2025

In this repository, I am trying to add all the RAG techniques that I am aware of till date, I will be adding more techniques as I come across them.

## List of RAG Techniques

| Technique Name                       | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple RAG                           | Basic implementation of the RAG framework.                                 |
| Semantic Chunking                    | Divides documents into semantically meaningful chunks.                     |
| Chunk Size Selector                  | Analyzes and selects optimal chunk sizes for retrieval.                    |
| Context Enriched RAG                 | Retrieves neighboring chunks to provide more context.                      |
| Contextual Chunk Headers             | Prepends descriptive headers to each chunk before embedding.               |
| Document Augmentation RAG            | Generates questions from text chunks to augment the retrieval process.     |
| Query Transform                      | Rewrites, expands, or decomposes queries to improve retrieval.             |
| Reranker                             | Re-ranks initially retrieved results using a language model.               |
| Relevant Segment Extraction (RSE)    | Identifies and reconstructs continuous segments of text.                   |
| Contextual Compression                | Filters and compresses retrieved chunks to maximize relevant information.   |
| Feedback Loop RAG                    | Incorporates user feedback to improve the RAG system over time.            |
| Adaptive RAG                         | Dynamically selects the best retrieval strategy based on query type.       |
| Self RAG                             | Implements a self-retrieval mechanism that evaluates relevance.            |
| Proposition Chunking                 | Breaks down documents into atomic, factual statements for precise retrieval.|
| Multimodel RAG                       | Combines text and images for retrieval, generating captions for images.    |
| Fusion RAG                           | Merges vector search with keyword-based retrieval for improved results.     |
| Graph RAG                            | Organizes knowledge as a graph for concept traversal.                      |
| Hierarchy RAG                        | Builds hierarchical indices for efficient retrieval.                       |
| HyDE RAG                             | Uses Hypothetical Document Embeddings for semantic matching.               |
| Corrective RAG (CRAG)                | Evaluates retrieval quality and uses web search as a fallback.             |
